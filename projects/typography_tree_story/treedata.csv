Black-Letter,Invention of the printing press,1452,Bible Letura,Gutenburg,Germany,movement,"Black-Letter is a family of typefaces derivative of the Carolignian miniscule introduced during Charlemagne's  rule of the Holy Roman Empire. It was comissioned so the literate class between different regions could read the same Bible. Over time, standardization waned as literacy increased and the demand for books increased required a quicker method of writing."

Oldstyle-Serif,Invention of the printing press,1465,Roman,Jensen,Italy ,movement,"During the Italian Rennesaince, Felice Feliciano completed a study on the geometry of Roman inscriptions as a part of the Humanist movement's Roman revival.Shortly after, Nicolas Jensen is inspired by the same Ancient Roman inscriptions and creates Roman, the first serif typeface."
Transitional-Serif,Serif,1692,Roman du Roi,Louis Simonneau and Phillippe Grandjean,France,movement,"The evolution of serifs into transitional typefaces marked the beginning of modern typefaces. This class oftypefaces, created during The Enlightenment, show the spirit of the movement in their adherence to Rationalism.Roman du Roi is the epitome of rational design. It favors a strict, logical mapping of each letter to an 8x8 grid.This contrasts with the developement of old style typefaces which gradually developed as they were passed down from engraver to engraver."
