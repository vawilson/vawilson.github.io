Invention of the printing press,,1440,Gutenberg invents the printing press,Johannes Gutenbergï¿½,Germany,movement,,,
Black-Letter,Invention of the printing press,1452,Bible Letura,Gutenburg,Germany,movement,"Black-Letter is a family of typefaces derivative of the Carolignian miniscule introduced during Charlemagne's  rule of the Holy Roman Empire. It was comissioned so the literate class between different regions could read the same Bible. Over time, as literacy increased, so did the demand for books. One foundry could no longer produce all of the books in the region so new operations began. This led to a decrease in standardization and thus the slow mutation from Carolignian miniscule to Black-Letter.",The Rule of Charlemagne,Fraktur
Serif,Oldstyle-Serif,1469,Roman,Jensen,Italy,movement,,,
Sans-Serif,Invention of the printing press,1748,National Trust,ÊPaul Barnes,UK,movement,"The Stourtan family of Wiltshire took trendy Neoclassicism a bit too far when they structured their estate to resemble scenes from Greek Mythology. They equipped their gardens with three temples, a pantheon, and created an artifical lake and path to evoke imagery of Aeneus's descent into the underworld. The first sans-serif font, National Trust, was inscribed into an artificial grotto spelling out the words of the epitath The Nymph of Spring. This is the first recorded occurance of sans-serif script since classical antiquity and it was meant to conjure an image of the time.",Neo-Classicism,Franklin
Oldstyle-Serif,Invention of the printing press,1465,Roman,Jensen,Italy ,movement,"During the Italian Renaissance, Felice Feliciano completed a study on the geometry of Roman inscriptions as a part of the Humanist movement's Roman revival. Shortly after, Nicolas Jensen was inspired by the same Ancient Roman inscriptions and created Roman, the first serif typeface.",The Italian Renaissance,Jensen
Transitional-Serif,Serif,1692,Roman du Roi,Louis Simonneau and Phillippe Grandjean,France,movement,"The evolution of serifs into transitional typefaces marked the beginning of modern typefaces. This class of typefaces, created during The Enlightenment, show the spirit of the movement in their adherence to Rationalism. Roman du Roi is the epitome of rational design. It favors a strict, logical mapping of each letter to an 8x8 grid.This contrasts with the developement of old style typefaces which gradually developed as they were passed down from engraver to engraver.",The Enlightenment,
Slab-Serif,Serif,1815,Antique,Vincent Figginsï¿½,UK,movement,"Following Napolean's campaign into Egypt in the early 1800s, the West plunged into a fit of Egyptomania. Napolean had brought 167 scholars on his campaign who returned with troves of new information on ancient Egypt.  An intense obsession with Egyptian culture followed: people decorated their homes with furniture modeled after Egyptian tombs and wallpaper reminiscent of the walls of an ancient temple. Marketers dubbed slab-serif fonts ""Egyptians"" despite having little connection to their writing system, and so slab-serif was able to reap the rewards of the trend.",Egyptomania,
Didone-Serif,Transitional-Serif,1784,Didot,Firmin Didot ,France ,movement,"As factories perfected mass produced type, the modern poster advertisement became increasingly popular. The pinncale of Didone type use occurred in the 1850s when advertisors needed a bold, eye-catching type legible from a distance. ",The Industrial Revolution,Bodoni
Grotesque,Sans-Serif,1816,ï¿½Two Lines English Egyptian,William Caslon IV,UK,movement,"First dubbed ""Grotesque"" by the typography world due to it's lack of serifs and unbalanced nature, the early sans-serif types were soon championed by Bauhaus as a part of their Art Nouveau Movement. They favored sans-serif fonts as their simplified forms were more applicable and useful than old ornamental fonts. They cared more about the clairity of the message than typography as an art form.",Art Nouveau Movement,
Neo-grotesque,Grotesque,1957,"Helvetica, Univers, Folio",,Switzerland,movement,"Emerging in the 1950s, Neo-grotesque type emphasized objectivity and neutrality. It was a reaction to the previous style to create ""beauty for the sake of beauty"" instead of valuing the function of type. This became increasingly important post-WWII as countries sought stronger, trade-focused relationships. International communication needed neutral glyphs which did not associate with a particular culture. Neo-grotesque typography filled this need by abiding by International Typographic Style.",International Typographic Style,
Geometric,Sans-Serif,1925,Erbar,Jakob Erbar,Germany,movement,"It wasn't until the 1970s that the perfect circle and square figures of geometric type became popular. With the invention of computers and the beginning of the space age, Futura and other geometric typefaces became associated with technological innovation. Futura was even the first typeface to make it to the moon aboard Apollo 11.",The Computer Age,
Humanist,Sans-Serif,1916,Johnston,Edward Johnston,UK,movement,"Traditionally used to describe the calligraphic typefaces created during the Renaissance, a Humanist revival occurred in the early 1900s as a backlash against the geometric designs popular in its day. Humanist designs were incredibly popular in the 1980s and 90s as a result of the invention of the computer. Low resolutions screens needed legible typefaces and humanist designs proved to be some of the easiest to read.",The Renaissance,

They believe in making typography an accesible field by providing free typefaces beginners can learn from. The movement became increasingly popular when web browsers started allowing developers to use embedded fonts rather than select from a small list of web fonts. I used open source fonts extensively in this project for the movement titles.",The Open Source Movement,
Fraktur,Black-Letter,1515,,,Germany,movement,"Antiqua and Fraktur were the most common German typefaces and were traditionally used for different texts. This changed in 1806 following the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire and the emphasis of nationalist German cultural values in the area of deisgn. Antiqua at this time was deemed ""un-German"" while the depth and seriousness of Fraktur exemplified classical German virtues. This debate continued into the 20th century when the Nazi party used Fraktur in their writing until the Ministry of Propaganda decided German-occupied countries had difficulty understanding Fraktur. Thus, Antiqua became popular for the Nazis and Fraktur was outlawed.",Antiqua-Fraktur Debate,Fraktur
