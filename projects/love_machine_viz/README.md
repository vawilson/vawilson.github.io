Explanation of Project:

  The first page is just an overview of our project to give a brief introduction. The second page focuses on finding your pool.  We had a total of 1960 responses in our data set. Given your gender, sexual orientation, and ethnicity, our visualization shows how many individuals would be potentially interested in you based on the responses to the survey. This number is known as your pool and is seen on the right based on the number of hearts highlighted. The pool is very large, so we chose to represent 10 people with each heart and use a 14 x 14 grid. Essentially, every selection you input (based on ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation) the pool gets smaller as certain individuals will be eliminated from your pool based on their response to certain questions in the survey. This isnâ€™t just about what you want in a partner but also is considering what other people are looking for as well. The third page allows you to fill out a questionnaire and see how your answers compare to your pool or the average GT student. The questions used for the questionnaire are the most controversial questions from the survey. If you hover over the dots on the radar chart you can see the exact averages for each label. You can also click on each label depending on if you want that category to be shown or be hidden.
